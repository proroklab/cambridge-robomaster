  description: Organize the wire harness so that the two red wires are between the two topmost distance bolts, the power supply are between the opposite distance bolts and the CAN connector between the two right distance bolts. If the cables are too long, tuck them into the hole of the base unit as appropriate. Thread through the two red wires through the hole on the top of the base plate. Align the D131 power jack connector so that it fits into the cutout on the other end of the base plate. Screw in the base plate with the four M4 screws originally used to mount the turret on the RoboMaster.
